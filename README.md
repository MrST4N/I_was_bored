# "I was bored and..."
Random little programs, because I wanted to code

### I/ XKCD Inspired GeoHashing
Want to travel ? Don't know where to go ? Just Ask !

Little python script inspired from XKCD's geohashing algorithm
(http://wiki.xkcd.com/geohashing/Main_Page)

Based on time rather than stock actions :D (Python)

### II/ Fake Zip Compressor
Stupid but entertaining. Fake Windows compressor that instead of compressing the
file, delete it and display an error message. (C#)


### III/ FBI Database

Mac applications that simulates a FBI Database. Like in movies, ya know' !
(Swift)


### IV/ Projects Generators

For: C and C++

Generate a simple Makefile, main, header and project file to begin any C/C++
project.
Includes usual libraries in the header.
Was mostly used in 3rd year to get ready for rushs


### V/ Random Scripts

Random scripts I made for \*kof\* useful \*kof\* purposes.
- Check website for updates (sh): Simple but effective, informs you when a website has changed.
- Random commits generator (sh): Get one stupid message from whatthecommit, and commits with it (this repo uses it)
- QEE (Quickly Extract Everything) (py): Extracts every archive in the current directory (WIP)

### VI/ Chip8 emulator
Self explanatory.
