- XKCD Inspired GeoHashing
Want to travel ? Don't know where to go ? Just Ask !

Little python script inspired from XKCD's geohashing algorithm (http://wiki.xkcd.com/geohashing/Main_Page)

Based on time rather than stock actions :D

Stupid but entertaining. Fake compressor that instead of compressing the file, delete it and display an error message.
